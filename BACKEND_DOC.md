üé® FRONTEND INTEGRATION GUIDELINES
Base URL Configuration
```javascript
const API_BASE_URL = 'http://localhost:8000'; // Development
// const API_BASE_URL = 'https://api.yourcompany.com'; // Production
```

Authentication Setup
```javascript
// Store tokens in localStorage or secure storage
const authToken = localStorage.getItem('access_token');
const refreshToken = localStorage.getItem('refresh_token');

// API request headers
const headers = {
  'Authorization': `Bearer ${authToken}`,
  'Content-Type': 'application/json'
};
```

Error Handling
```javascript
// Standard error response format
{
  "detail": "Error message",
  "status_code": 400,
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"
}

// Handle 401 responses by refreshing token
if (response.status === 401) {
  // Attempt token refresh
  // If refresh fails, redirect to login
}
```

File Upload Handling
```javascript
// For responses with file attachments
const formData = new FormData();
formData.append('file', fileInput.files[0]);
formData.append('content', responseText);
formData.append('response_type', 'file');

fetch(`${API_BASE_URL}/responses/`, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`
  },
  body: formData
});
```

üîß ENVIRONMENT SETUP
Required Environment Variables
```env
# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost/wellness_db

# Authentication
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-change-in-production
ALGORITHM=HS256

# AI Processing
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key

# Optional: Redis for caching
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
```

Development Dependencies
```bash
# Backend requirements are in requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Key packages for frontend integration:
# - FastAPI with CORS enabled
# - JWT authentication
# - File upload support
# - WebSocket support (future feature)
```

‚ö†Ô∏è KNOWN LIMITATIONS & WORKAROUNDS
CORS Configuration: Currently set to allow all origins (*) - restrict in production
File Size Limits: No explicit limits set - implement client-side validation
Rate Limiting: Not implemented - consider adding for production
WebSocket Support: Planned but not yet implemented for real-time features

üöÄ RECOMMENDED FRONTEND ARCHITECTURE
Suggested Tech Stack
React/Vue.js/Angular for UI framework
Axios/Fetch for API communication
React Query/SWR for data fetching and caching
React Router/Vue Router for navigation
Tailwind CSS/Material-UI for styling

Key Components to Build
Authentication Components: Login, Register, Profile
Dashboard: Overview, Statistics, Recent Activity
Program Management: List, Details, Enrollment
Response System: Create, Edit, Submit, Review
AI Insights: Display insights, recommendations, analytics
Admin Panel: User management, system monitoring

State Management Recommendations
Use context/store for authentication state
Implement proper loading and error states
Cache frequently accessed data (user profile, programs)
Handle offline scenarios gracefully
